# CS300
Repository for the work in my CS 300 DSA: Analysis and Design course at SNHU

In the projects for this course, I was trying to create an algorithm that would open and read a file, input the information from the file into a data structure, and then make that information searchable and sortable while maintaining efficiency and speed. Data structures are important to understand because there are many different ways to store data in a system, but they are not all created equally. Some may be faster to add new data to, while others have more efficient ways to search them, while still others are optimized for multifaceted data. Knowing which data structure is right for the job is important to overall system efficiency. My biggest roadblocks with designing my algorithms were remembering how to code certain methods. To get around these, I spent some extra time going through the coursework and online text book, plus spent some time Googling methods of doign what I needed to do. Knowing how to tackle everything I learned in this course has helped me pay attention more to what is most efficient in a system, not just what is easiest for me to program. This course definitely helped solidify how I write my code to ensure it is maintainable, readable and adaptable.
